Tolaz suggests: Not working on the menu for now.
	Sound good.

Tolaz suggests: having input array list inside the gates instead of in the LogicGate class
	I dont think it will even look nice if we do that.

Tolaz and Tim suggest: find an alternative data structure to store the gates a level at a time (linked list maybe)
	You will so need all node to be connect to display them. Think of the cps209 A2
	If one node is not connect to the main node than you can not draw it. Or if you want to have an array of
	all Start node then you will still need an array.

Tolaz suggests: restructure the main class
	I am for this but ATM we dont know what we need over all.
	
Tim suggests (in the future): implementing circular right click menu style
	Good idea
